### **_Description_**

#### I am a coffee connoisseur. I love it. I need it.

#### I particularly enjoy filling my bean hopper with unique small batch roasts from independently owned roasteries. The problem is that they are difficult to find. They are typically buried under the large corporate operations that shell out the big bucks for advertisement and search engine optimization.

#### **_Enter the Roaster Roster!_**

This is an app for 3 types of users.
- The Roaster
- The Retailer
- The Connoisseur

The Roaster (the roasterie owner) can set up a profile for their roasterie. On that profile, they can keep an up to date (fully mutable) list of the beans they are roasting with details such as:
- Bean origin
- Roast type
- Price per unit
- Links to purchase directly from their shop
- A list of retailers who sell their beans in person


### **_Technologies Used_**

- Python
- Django

### **Future Development Opportunity (Post MVP)**

#### A feature that lets users rate individual bean roasts on a scale of 1-5 beans.

#### A favoriting feature that bookmarks beans and Roasters for Retailers and Connoisseur to come back and quickly find what they already know they love.

#### Connoisseur reiwes.

#### Search Filters:
- Price
- Roast type
- Origin
- Average Rating
- Location
